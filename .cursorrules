# Cursor Rules for Agentic Base

This file provides guidance to Cursor AI when working with this repository.

## Development Workflow

This project follows a strict agent-driven development process. Always refer to the following documents before suggesting changes or implementing code:

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**: Rules and guidance for AI agents (formerly CLAUDE.md).
- **[PROCESS.md](./PROCESS.md)**: The comprehensive 7-phase development lifecycle.
- **[docs/a2a/model-config.md](./docs/a2a/model-config.md)**: Current model selection and configuration.

## Key Principles

1. **Follow the Workflow**: Do not skip phases (PRD -> SDD -> Sprint -> Implementation -> Review -> Audit -> Deploy).
2. **Document Everything**: Use the `docs/` and `docs/a2a/` directories as the source of truth for planning and feedback.
3. **Model Selection**: If you need to switch model profiles, use the helper script: `./scripts/update-models.sh`.
4. **Context Maintenance**: Keep the context chain for other agents by updating `reviewer.md` and addressing `engineer-feedback.md`.

## Integration

- When providing code suggestions, check the latest sprint task in `docs/sprint.md`.
- Ensure all new features have corresponding unit tests as per `AGENTS.md` requirements.
